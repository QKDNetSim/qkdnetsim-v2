 *
 * The ns3::NetDevice includes IP-specific API such as GetMulticast(), Send()
 * and SendTo() methods, which do not map well the the 802.15.4 MAC MCPS
 * DataRequest primitive.  So, the basic design is to provide, as
 * much as makes sense, the class ns3::NetDevice API, but rely on the user
 * accessing the LrWpanMac pointer to make 802.15.4-specific API calls.
 * As such, this is really just an encapsulating class.
