 *  Channel 12                                (Orphan Scan channels 11-14)
 *
 *
 * This example demonstrate the usage of the MAC MLME-SCAN.request (ORPHAN scan) primitive as
 * described by IEEE 802.15.4-2011 (See Figures 14 and 15).
 *
 * Orphan scan is used typically on devices as a result of repeated communication failures
 * (For example, lossing too many ACK). An orphan scan represents the attempt of a device to
 * relocate its coordinator. In some situations, it can be used by devices higher layers to not only
 * rejoin a network but also join a network for the first time (Like in the joining through
 * orphaning mechanism described in Zigbee networks).
 *
 * In this example, the end device is set to scan 4 channels (11~14) for a period of
 * macResponseWaitTime until it finally gets in contact with the coordinator.
 * On contact, the coordinator responds to the device (via coordinator realignment command)
 * an assign it a short address. The detailed sequence of events is as following:
 *
 * 1) [Time 2s] The coordinator start a network in channel 12.
 * 2) [Time 3s] The end device start orphan scan and transmits a orphan
 *    notification cmd on channel 11.
 * 3) No response is received in channel 11, therefore, the device ends scanning on
 *    channel 11 after macResponseWaitTime and repeats step 2 in channel 12.
 * 4) [Time 3.00269s] The orphan notification command is received by the coordinator in
 *    channel 12. The coordinator verify the requesting device and replies to the device
 *    with a coordinator realignment command containing the assigned short address [DE:AF].
 * 5) [Time 3.00646s] The device receives the coordinator realignment command, update its
 *    macPanId, macShortAddress, macCoordShortAddress and macCoordExtAddress.
 * 6) Scanning of the remaining channels 13 and 14 is cancelled.
