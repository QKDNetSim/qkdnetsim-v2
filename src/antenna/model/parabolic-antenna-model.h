 * \brief  Antenna model based on a parabolic approximation of the main lobe radiation pattern.
 *
 * This class implements the parabolic model as described in some 3GPP document, e.g., R4-092042
 *
 * A similar model appears in:
 *
 * George Calcev and Matt Dillon, "Antenna Tilt Control in CDMA Networks"
 * in Proc. of the 2nd Annual International Wireless Internet Conference (WICON), 2006
 *
 * though the latter addresses also the elevation plane, which the present model doesn't.
