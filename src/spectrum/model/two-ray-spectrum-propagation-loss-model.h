/**
 * \ingroup spectrum
 * \brief Two Ray Spectrum Propagation Loss Model
 *
 * This class implements a performance-oriented channel and beamforming models alternative to the
 * ThreeGppSpectrumPropagationLossModel and ThreeGppChannelModel. The main method is
 * DoCalcRxPowerSpectralDensity, which takes as input the power spectral density (PSD) of the
 * transmitted signal, the mobility models of the transmitting node and receiving node, and returns
 * the PSD of the received signal.
 *
 * The fading model is calibrated with the ThreeGppChannelModel, aiming to provide an end-to-end
 * channel gain which matches as much as possible the TR 38.901-based channel model. Therefore, this
 * model is to be used for large-scale simulations of MIMO wireless networks, for which the
 * ThreeGppChannelModel would prove too computationally intensive. The target applicability of this
 * model, in terms of frequency range, is 0.5-100 GHz.

     * The calibration has been undertaken using the 3GPP 38.901 as a reference. The latter's
     * small-scale fading distributions depend on the scenario (UMa, UMi, RMa, InH), the LOS
     * condition (LOS/NLOS) and the carrier frequency. Therefore, the output of the calibration is a
     * map associating such simulation parameters to the specific FTR parameters. Specifically, such
     * parameters represent the FTR distribution yielding channel realizations which exhibit the
     * closest statistics to the small-scale fading obtained when using the 3GPP 38.901 model. The
     * estimation relies on reference curves obtained by collecting multiple 38.901 channel
     * realizations and computing the corresponding end-to-end channel gain by setting the speed of
     * the TX and RX pair to 0, disabling the shadowing and fixing the LOS condition. In such a way,
     * any variation of the received power around the mean is given by the small-scale fading only.
     * Finally, the reference ECDF of the channel gains is compared to the ECDF obtained from the
     * FTR distribution using different values of the parameters. The parameters which provide the
     * best fit (in a goodness-of-fit sense) are kept for the specific scenario, LOS condition and
     * carrier frequency. The goodness of the fit is measured using the well-known Anderson-Darling
     * metric.
