Design
======


Signal model
############

The signal model is implemented by the
``SpectrumSignalParameters`` class. This class provides the following
information for a signal being transmitted/received by PHY devices:

* a reference to the transmitting PHY device

* a reference to the antenna model used by the transmitting PHY device
  to transmit this signal

* the duration of the signal

* the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the signal, which is assumed to be constant for
  the duration of the signal

* the frequency domain 3D spectrum channel matrix that is needed for MIMO computations
  when multiple streams are transmitted

* the 3D precoding matrix that is needed for MIMO computations when multiple
  streams are transmitted.

The PSD is represented as a set of discrete scalar values each
corresponding to a certain subband in frequency. The set of frequency subbands
to which the PSD refers to is defined by an instance of the
``SpectrumModel`` class. The PSD itself is implemented as an instance
of the ``SpectrumValue`` class which contains a reference to the
associated ``SpectrumModel`` class instance. The ``SpectrumValue``
class provides several arithmetic operators to allow to perform calculations
with PSD instances. Additionally, the ``SpectrumConverter`` class
provides means for the conversion of ``SpectrumValue`` instances from
one ``SpectrumModel`` to another.

The frequency domain 3D channel matrix is needed in MIMO systems in which
multiple transmit and receive antenna ports can exist, hence the PSD is multidimensional.
The dimensions are: the number of receive antenna ports, the number of
transmit antenna ports, and the number of subbands in frequency (or
resource blocks).

The 3D precoding matrix is also needed in MIMO systems to be able to correctly
perform the calculations of the received signal and interference. The dimensions are:
the number of transmit antenna ports, the number of transmit
streams, and the number of subbands (or resource blocks).

For a more formal mathematical description of the signal model just
described, the reader is referred to [Baldo2009Spectrum]_.

The ``SpectrumSignalParameters`` class is meant to include only
information that is valid for all signals; as such, it is not meant to
be modified to add technology-specific information (such as type of
modulation and coding schemes used, info on preambles and reference
signals, etc). Instead, such information shall be put in a new class
that inherits from ``SpectrumSignalParameters`` and extends it with
any technology-specific information that is needed. This design
is intended to model the fact that in the real world we have signals
of different technologies being simultaneously transmitted and
received over the air.



Channel/PHY interface
#####################

The spectrum Channel/PHY interface is defined by the base classes ``SpectrumChannel``
and ``SpectrumPhy``. Their interaction simulates the transmission and
reception of signals over the medium. The way this interaction works is depicted in :ref:`fig-spectrum-channel-phy-interface`:


.. _fig-spectrum-channel-phy-interface:

.. figure:: figures/spectrum-channel-phy-interface.*
   :align: center

Spectrum Channel implementations
################################

The module provides two ``SpectrumChannel`` implementations:
``SingleModelSpectrumChannel`` and ``MultiModelSpectrumChannel``. They
both provide this functionality:

 * Propagation loss modeling, in three forms:

   - you can plug models based on ``PropagationLossModel`` on these
     channels. Only linear models (where the loss value does not
     depend on the transmission power) can be used.
     These models are single-frequency in the sense that the loss value is
     applied equally to all components of the power spectral density.

   - you can plug models based on ``SpectrumPropagationLossModel`` on these
     channels. These models can have frequency-dependent loss, i.e.,
     a separate loss value is calculated and applied to each component
     of the power spectral density.

   - you can plug models based on ``PhasedArraySpectrumPropagationLossModel``
     on these channels. These models can have frequency-dependent loss, i.e.,
     a separate loss value is calculated and applied to each component
     of the power spectral density. Additionally, these models support
     the phased antenna array at the transmitter and the receiver, i.e.,
     ns-3 antenna type ``PhasedArrayModel``.


 * Propagation delay modeling, by plugging a model based on
   ``PropagationDelayModel``. The delay is independent of frequency and
   applied to the signal as a whole. Delay modeling is implemented by
   scheduling the ``StartRx`` event with a delay respect to the
   ``StartTx`` event.

``SingleModelSpectrumChannel`` and ``MultiModelSpectrumChannel`` are
quite similar, the main difference is that
``MultiModelSpectrumChannel`` allows to use different
``SpectrumModel`` instances with the same channel instance, by
automatically taking care of the conversion of PSDs among the
different models.



.. _sec-example-model-implementations:

Example model implementations
#############################


The spectrum module provides some basic implementation of several components that
are mainly intended as a proof-of-concept and as an example for
building custom models with the spectrum module. Here is a brief list
of the available implementations:

 * ``SpectrumModel300Khz300GhzLog`` and
   ``SpectrumModelIsm2400MhzRes1Mhz`` are two example ``SpectrumModel`` implementations

 * ``HalfDuplexIdealPhy``: a basic PHY model using a gaussian
   interference model (implemented in ``SpectrumInterference``)
   together with an error model based on Shannon capacity (described
   in [Baldo2009Spectrum]_ and implemented in ``SpectrumErrorModel``. This PHY
   uses the ``GenericPhy`` interface. Its additional custom signal
   parameters are defined in ``HalfDuplexIdealPhySignalParameters``.

 * ``WifiSpectrumValueHelper`` is an helper object that makes it easy
   to create ``SpectrumValues`` representing PSDs and RF filters for
   the wifi technology.

 * ``AlohaNoackNetDevice``: a minimal NetDevice that allows to send
   packets over ``HalfDuplexIdealPhy`` (or other PHY model based on
   the  ``GenericPhy`` interface).

 * ``SpectrumAnalyzer``, ``WaveformGenerator`` and ``MicrowaveOven`` are examples of PHY
   models other than communication devices - the names should be
   self-explaining.

Usage
*****

The main use case of the spectrum model is for developers who want to
develop a new model for the PHY layer of some wireless technology to
be used within ns-3.
Here are some notes on how the spectrum module is expected to be used.

 * ``SpectrumPhy`` and ``SpectrumChannel`` are abstract base classes. Real
   code will use classes that inherit from these classes.

 * If you are implementing a new model for some wireless
   technology of your interest, and want to use the spectrum module,
   you'll typically create your own module and make it depend on the
   spectrum module. Then you typically have to implement:

    - a child class of ``SpectrumModel`` which defines the (sets of) frequency
      subbands used by the considered wireless technology. **Note**:
      instances of ``SpectrumModel`` are typically statically allocated,
      in order to allow several ``SpectrumValue`` instances to reference
      the same ``SpectrumModel`` instance.

    - a child class of ``SpectrumPhy`` which will handle transmission and
      reception of signals (including, if appropriate, interference
      and error modeling).

    - a child class of ``SpectrumSignalParameters`` which will contain
      all the information needed to model the signals for the wireless
      technology being considered that is not already provided by the
      base ``SpectrumSignalParameters`` class. Examples of such
      information are the type of modulation and coding schemes used,
      the PHY preamble format, info on the pilot/reference signals, etc.

 * The available ``SpectrumChannel`` implementations
   (``SingleModelSpectrumChannel`` and ``MultiModelSpectrumChannel``,
   are quite generic. Chances are you can use them as-is. Whether you
   prefer one or the other it is just a matter of whether you will
   have a single SpectrumModel or multiple ones in your
   simulations.

 * Typically, there will be a single SpectrumChannel instance to which
   several SpectrumPhy instances are plugged. The rule of thumb is
   that all PHYs that are interfering with each other shall be plugged
   on the same channel. Multiple SpectrumChannel instances are
   expected to be used mainly when simulating completely orthogonal
   channels; for example, when simulating the uplink and downlink
   of a Frequency Division Duplex system, it is a good choice to use
   two SpectrumChannel instances in order to reduce computational
   complexity.

 * Different types of SpectrumPhy (i.e., instances of different child
   classes) can be plugged on the same SpectrumChannel instance. This
   is one of the main features of the
   spectrum module, to support inter-technology interference. For
   example, if you implement a WifiSpectrumPhy and a
   BluetoothSpectrumPhy, and plug both on a SpectrumChannel, then you'll
   be able to simulate interference between wifi and bluetooth and
   vice versa.

 * Different child classes of ``SpectrumSignalParameters`` can coexist
   in the same simulation, and be transmitted over the same channel
   object.  Again, this is part of the support for inter-technology
   interference. A PHY device model is expected to use the
   ``DynamicCast<>`` operator to determine if a signal is of a certain
   type it can attempt to receive. If not, the signal is normally
   expected to be considered as interference.

*  Many propagation loss and delay models can be added to these channels.
   The base class ``SpectrumChannel`` provides an ``AssignStreams()`` method
   to allow the deterministic configuration of random variable stream numbers
   with a single API call.  See the ns-3 Manual chapter on random variables
   for more information.


Helpers
=======


The helpers provided in ``src/spectrum/helpers`` are mainly intended
for the example implementations described in :ref:`sec-example-model-implementations`.
If you are developing your custom model based on the
spectrum framework, you will probably prefer to define your own
helpers.



Attributes
==========


 * Both ``SingleModelSpectrumChannel`` and
   ``MultiModelSpectrumChannel`` have an attribute ``MaxLossDb`` which
   can use to avoid propagating signals affected by very high
   propagation loss. You can use this to reduce the complexity of
   interference calculations. Just be careful to choose a value that
   does not make the interference calculations inaccurate.

 * The example implementations described in :ref:`sec-example-model-implementations` also have several attributes.





Output
======


 * Both ``SingleModelSpectrumChannel`` and
   ``MultiModelSpectrumChannel`` provide a trace source called
   ``PathLoss`` which is fired whenever a new path loss value is
   calculated. **Note**: only single-frequency path loss is accounted
   for, see the attribute description.

 * The example implementations described in :ref:`sec-example-model-implementations` also provide some trace sources.

 * The helper class ``SpectrumAnalyzerHelper`` can be conveniently
   used to generate an output text file containing the spectrogram
   produced by a SpectrumAnalyzer instance. The format is designed to
   be easily plotted with ``gnuplot``. For example, if your run the
   example ``adhoc-aloha-ideal-phy-with-microwave-oven`` you will get
   an output file called ``spectrum-analyzer-output-3-0.tr``. From
   this output file, you can generate a figure similar to
   :ref:`fig-spectrum-analyzer-example` by executing the following
   gnuplot commands:

.. sourcecode:: none

    unset surface
    set pm3d at s
    set palette
    set key off
    set view 50,50
    set xlabel "time (ms)"
    set ylabel "freq (MHz)"
    set zlabel "PSD (dBW/Hz)" offset 15,0,0
    splot "./spectrum-analyzer-output-3-0.tr" using ($1*1000.0):($2/1e6):(10*log10($3))



Examples
========


The example programs in ``src/spectrum/examples/`` allow to see the
example implementations described in :ref:`sec-example-model-implementations` in action.


Troubleshooting
===============

 * **Disclaimer on inter-technology interference**: the spectrum model
   makes it very easy to implement an inter-technology interference
   model, but this does not guarantee
   that the resulting model is accurate. For example, the gaussian
   interference model implemented in the ``SpectrumInterference`` class can be used
   to calculate inter-technology interference, however the results might not be valid in some
   scenarios, depending on the actual waveforms involved, the number
   of interferers, etc. Moreover, it is very important to use error
   models that are consistent with the interference model. The
   responsibility of ensuring that the models being used are correct
   is left to the user.





Testing
*******

In this section we describe the test suites that are provided within
the spectrum module.

SpectrumValue test
==================

The test suite ``spectrum-value`` verifies the correct functionality of the arithmetic
operators implemented by the ``SpectrumValue`` class. Each test case
corresponds to a different operator. The test passes if the result
provided by the operator implementation is equal to the reference
values which were calculated offline by hand. Equality is verified
within a tolerance of :math:`10^{-6}` which is to account for
numerical errors.


SpectrumConverter test
======================

The test suite ``spectrum-converter`` verifies the correct
functionality of the ``SpectrumConverter`` class. Different test cases
correspond to the conversion of different ``SpectrumValue`` instances
to different ``SpectrumModel`` instances. Each test passes if the
``SpectrumValue`` instance resulting from the conversion is equal to the reference
values which were calculated offline by hand. Equality is verified
within a tolerance of :math:`10^{-6}` which is to account for
numerical errors.


Describe how the model has been tested/validated.  What tests run in the
test suite?  How much API and code is covered by the tests?  Again,
references to outside published work may help here.




Interference test
=================

The test suite ``spectrum-interference`` verifies the correct
functionality of the ``SpectrumInterference`` and
``ShannonSpectrumErrorModel`` in a scenario involving four
signals (an intended signal plus three interferers). Different test
cases are created corresponding to different PSDs of the intended
signal and different amount of transmitted bytes. The test passes if
the output of the error model (successful or failed) coincides with
the expected one which was determine offline by manually calculating
the achievable rate using Shannon's formula.


IdealPhy test
=============

The test verifies that ``AlohaNoackNetDevice`` and
``HalfDuplexIdealPhy`` work properly when installed in a node. The
test recreates a scenario with two nodes (a TX and a RX) affected by a path loss such
that a certain SNR is obtained. The TX node transmits with a
pre-determined PHY rate and with an application layer rate which is
larger than the PHY rate, so as to saturate the
channel. ``PacketSocket`` is used in order to avoid protocol
overhead. Different
test cases correspond to different PHY rate and SNR values. For each
test case, we calculated offline (using Shannon's formula) whether
the PHY rate is achievable or not. Each test case passes if the
following conditions are satisfied:

 * if the PHY rate is achievable, the application throughput shall be within
   :math:`1\%` of the PHY rate;

 * if the PHY rate is not achievable, the application throughput shall
   be zero.




Additional Models
*****************

TV Transmitter Model
====================

A TV Transmitter model is implemented by the ``TvSpectrumTransmitter`` class.
This model enables transmission of realistic TV signals to be simulated and can
be used for interference modeling. It provides a customizable power spectral
density (PSD) model, with configurable attributes including the type of
modulation (with models for analog, 8-VSB, and COFDM), signal bandwidth,
power spectral density level, frequency, and transmission duration. A helper
class, ``TvSpectrumTransmitterHelper``, is also provided to assist users in
setting up simulations.

Main Model Class
################

The main TV Transmitter model class, ``TvSpectrumTransmitter``, provides a
user-configurable PSD model that can be transmitted on the ``SpectrumChannel``.
It inherits from ``SpectrumPhy`` and is comprised of attributes and methods to
create and transmit the signal on the channel.

.. _spectrum-tv-cofdm:

.. figure:: figures/spectrum-tv-cofdm.*
   :align: center

   8K COFDM signal spectrum generated from ``TvSpectrumTransmitter`` (Left) and
   theoretical COFDM signal spectrum [KoppCOFDM]_ (Right)

One of the user-configurable attributes is the type of modulation for the TV
transmitter to use. The options are 8-VSB (Eight-Level Vestigial Sideband
Modulation) which is notably used in the North America ATSC digital television
standard, COFDM (Coded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) which is
notably used in the DVB-T and ISDB-T digital television standards adopted by
various countries around the world, and analog modulation which is a legacy
technology but is still being used by some countries today. To accomplish
realistic PSD models for these modulation types, the signals’ PSDs were
approximated from real standards and developed into models that are scalable by
frequency and power. The COFDM PSD is approximated from Figure 12 (8k mode) of
[KoppCOFDM]_, the 8-VSB PSD is approximated from Figure 3 of [Baron8VSB]_, and the
analog PSD is approximated from Figure 4 of [QualcommAnalog]_. Note that the
analog model is approximated from the NTSC standard, but other analog modulation
standards such as PAL have similar signals. The approximated COFDM PSD model is
in 8K mode. The other configurable attributes are the start frequency,
signal/channel bandwidth, base PSD, antenna type, starting time,
and transmit duration.

``TvSpectrumTransmitter`` uses ``IsotropicAntennaModel`` as its antenna model by
default, but any model that inherits from ``AntennaModel`` is selectable, so
directional antenna models can also be used. The propagation loss models used
in simulation are configured in the ``SpectrumChannel`` that the user chooses to
use. Terrain and spherical Earth/horizon effects may be supported in future ns-3
propagation loss models.

After the attributes are set, along with the ``SpectrumChannel``,
``MobilityModel``, and node locations, the PSD of the TV transmitter signal can
be created and transmitted on the channel.

.. _sec-tv-helper-class:

Helper Class
############

The helper class, ``TvSpectrumTransmitterHelper``, consists of features to
assist users in setting up TV transmitters for their simulations. Functionality
is also provided to easily simulate real-world scenarios.

.. _spectrum-tv-8vsb:

.. figure:: figures/spectrum-tv-8vsb.*
   :align: center

   North America ATSC channel 19 & 20 signals generated using
   ``TvSpectrumTransmitterHelper`` (Left) and theoretical 8-VSB signal
   [Baron8VSB]_ (Right). Note that the theoretical signal is not shown in dB
   while the ns-3 generated signals are.

Using this helper class, users can easily set up TV transmitters right after
configuring attributes. Multiple transmitters can be created at a time. Also
included are real characteristics of specific geographic regions that can be
used to run realistic simulations. The regions currently included are
North America, Europe, and Japan. The frequencies and bandwidth of each TV
channel for each these regions are provided.

.. _spectrum-tv-rand-geo-points:

.. figure:: figures/spectrum-tv-rand-geo-points.*
   :align: center

   Plot from MATLAB implementation of CreateRegionalTvTransmitters method in
   ``TvSpectrumTransmitterHelper``. Shows 100 random points on Earth’s surface
   (with altitude 0) corresponding to TV transmitter locations within a 2000 km
   radius of 35° latitude and -100° longitude.

A method (CreateRegionalTvTransmitters) is provided that enables users to
randomly generate multiple TV transmitters from a specified region with a given
density within a chosen radius around a point on Earth’s surface. The region,
which determines the channel frequencies of the generated TV transmitters, can
be specified to be one of the three provided, while the density determines the
amount of transmitters generated. The TV transmitters' antenna heights
(altitude) above Earth's surface can also be randomly generated to be within a
given maximum altitude. This method models Earth as a perfect sphere, and
generated location points are referenced accordingly in Earth-Centered
Earth-Fixed Cartesian coordinates. Note that bodies of water on Earth are not
considered in location point generation--TV transmitters can be generated
anywhere on Earth around the origin point within the chosen maximum radius.

Examples
########

Two example simulations are provided that demonstrate the functionality of the
TV transmitter model. ``tv-trans-example`` simulates two 8-VSB TV transmitters
with adjacent channel frequencies. ``tv-trans-regional-example`` simulates
randomly generated COFDM TV transmitters (modeling the DVB-T standard)
located around the Paris, France area with channel frequencies and bandwidths
corresponding to the European television channel allocations.

Testing
#######

The ``tv-spectrum-transmitter`` test suite verifies the accuracy of the
spectrum/PSD model in ``TvSpectrumTransmitter`` by testing if the maximum power
spectral density, start frequency, and end frequency comply with expected values
for various test cases.

The ``tv-helper-distribution`` test suite verifies the functionality of the
method in ``TvSpectrumTransmitterHelper`` that generates a random number of TV
transmitters based on the given density (low, medium, or high) and maximum
number of TV channels. It verifies that the number of TV transmitters generated
does not exceed the expected bounds.

The CreateRegionalTvTransmitters method in ``TvSpectrumTransmitterHelper``
described in :ref:`sec-tv-helper-class` uses two methods from the
``GeographicPositions`` class in the Mobility module to generate the random
Cartesian points on or above earth's surface around an origin point which
correspond to TV transmitter positions. The first method converts Earth
geographic coordinates to Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed (ECEF) Cartesian
coordinates, and is tested in the ``geo-to-cartesian`` test suite by comparing
(with 10 meter tolerance) its output with the output of the geographic to ECEF
conversion function [MatlabGeo]_ of the MATLAB Mapping Toolbox for numerous
test cases. The other used method generates random ECEF Cartesian points around
the given geographic origin point, and is tested in the ``rand-cart-around-geo``
test suite by verifying that the generated points do not exceed the given
maximum distance radius from the origin point.

.. _3gpp-fast-fading-model:

3GPP TR 38.901 fast fading model
================================
The framework described by TR 38.901 [TR38901]_ is a 3D statistical Spatial
Channel Model supporting different propagation environments (e.g., urban,
rural, indoor), multi-antenna operations and the modeling of wireless channels
between 0.5 and 100 GHz.
The overall channel is represented by the matrix :math:`H(t,\tau)`, in which each
entry H :sub:`u,s` :math:`(t,\tau)` corresponds to the impulse response of the channel between the
s-th element of the transmitting antenna and the u-th element of the receiving
antenna. H :sub:`u,s` :math:`(t,\tau)` is generated by the superposition of N different multi-path
components, called clusters, each of which composed of M different rays.
The channel matrix generation procedure accounts for large and small scale
propagation phenomena. The classes ThreeGppSpectrumPropagationLossModel and
ThreeGppChannelModel included in the spectrum module take care of the generation
of the channel coefficients and the computation of the frequency-dependent
propagation loss.

Implementation
##############

Our implementation is described in [Zugno]_. It is based on the model described
in [Zhang]_, but the code has been refactored, extended, and aligned to TR 38.901
[TR38901]_.
The fundamental assumption behind this model is the channel reciprocity, i.e.,
the impulse response of the channel between node a and node b is the same as
between node b and node a.
To deal with the equivalence of the channel between a and b, no matter who is
the transmitter and who is the receiver, the model considers the pair of nodes
to be composed by one "s" and one "u" node. The channel matrix, as well as other
parameters, are saved and used under the assumption that, within a pair, the
definition of the "s" and "u" node will always be the same. For more details,
please have a look at the documentation of the classes
ThreeGppChannelModel and ThreeGppSpectrumPropagationLossModel.

**Note:**

  * Currently, no error model is provided; a link-to-system campaign may be
    needed to incorporate it in existing modules.

  * The model does not include any spatial consistency update procedure
    (see [TR38901]_, Sec. 7.6.1). The implementation of this feature is left
    as future work.

  * Issue regarding the blockage model: according to 3GPP TR 38.901 v15.0.0
    (2018-06) section 7.6.4.1, the blocking region for self-blocking is provided
    in LCS.

    However, here, clusterAOA and clusterZOA are in GCS and blocking check is
    performed for self-blocking similar to non-self blocking, that is in GCS.
    One would expect the angles to be transposed to LCS before checking
    self-blockage.


ThreeGppSpectrumPropagationLossModel
####################################

The class ThreeGppSpectrumPropagationLossModel implements the
PhasedArraySpectrumPropagationLossModel interface and enables the modeling of frequency
dependent propagation phenomena while taking into account the specific pair of the
phased antenna array at the transmitter and the receiver. The main method is
DoCalcRxPowerSpectralDensity, which takes as input the SpectrumSignalParameters
structure, which contains, among others, the power spectral density (PSD) of the
transmitted signal, and the precoding matrix of the transmitter which is needed
for MIMO computations. Other input parameters are the mobility models of the
transmitting and receiving node, and the phased antenna array of the
transmitting and receiving node.
DoCalcRxPowerSpectralDensity computes the PSD of the received signal
(used in case of single stream transmission), and the frequency domain 3D
channel matrix between receive and transmit antenna ports (needed for MIMO
computations when multiple streams are transmitted).
Finally, it returns the SpectrumSignalParameters which contains the
received PSD and the frequency domain 3D spectrum channel matrix.

Procedure used to compute the PSD of the received signal and the frequency domain 3D
spectrum channel matrix:

1. Retrieve the beamforming vectors
To account for the beamforming, ThreeGppSpectrumPropagationLossModel has to
retrieve the beamforming vectors of the transmitting and receiving antennas.
The method DoCalcRxPowerSpectralDensity uses the antenna objects
that are passed as parameters for both the transmitting and receiving devices,
and calls the method GetBeamformingVector to retrieve the beamforming vectors
of these antenna objects.

2. Retrieve the channel matrix and the channel params
The ThreeGppSpectrumPropagationLossModel relies on the ThreeGppChannelModel class
to obtain the channel matrix and channel parameters.
In particular, it makes use of the method GetChannel,
which returns a ChannelMatrix object containing the channel
matrix, the generation time, the node pair, and the phased antenna array pair among
which is created this channel matrix.
Additionally, it makes use of the method GetParams which
returns a ChannelParams object containing the channel parameters.
Notice that the channel information is split into these two structures
(ChannelMatrix and ChannelParams) to support multiple collocated phased antenna arrays at
TX/RX node. ChannelParams (also its specialization ThreeGppChannelParams structure)
contains parameters which are common for all the channels among
the same RX/TX node pair, while ChannelMatrix contains the channel matrix for the specific pair
of the phased antenna arrays of TX/RX nodes.
For example, if the TX and the RX node have multiple collocated antenna arrays,
then there will be multiple channel matrices among this pair of nodes for different pairs
of antenna arrays of the TX and the RX node.
These channel matrices that are among the same pair of nodes have common channel parameters,
i.e., they share the same channel condition, cluster powers, cluster delays,
AoD, AoA, ZoD, ZoA, K_factor, delay spread, etc.
On the other hand, each pair of TX and RX antenna arrays has a specific channel matrix
and fading, which depends on the actual antenna element positions and field patterns of
each pair of antenna array subpartitions.
The ThreeGppChannelModel instance is automatically
created in the ThreeGppSpectrumPropagationLossModel constructor and it can
be configured by using the method SetChannelModelAttribute.

Notice that in MultiModelSpectrumChannel it is checked whether the TX/RX
SpectrumPhy instances belong to different TX/RX nodes.
This is needed to avoid pathloss models calculations among
the phased antenna arrays of the same node, because there are no models yet
in ns-3 that support the calculation of this kind of interference.

4. Compute the long term component
The method GetLongTerm returns the long term component obtained by multiplying
the channel matrix and the beamforming vectors. The function CalculateLongTermComponent
calculates the long term component per RX and TX port pair. Finally, GetLongTerm
returns a 3D long term channel matrix whose dimensions are the number of the
receive antenna ports, the number transmit antenna ports, and
the number of clusters. When multiple ports are being configured note that
the sub-array partition model is adopted for TXRU virtualization, as described
in Section 5.2.2 of 3GPP TR 36.897[TR36897]_, and so equal beam weights are used for all the ports.
Support of the full-connection model for TXRU virtualization would need extensions.
To reduce the computational load, the long term
components associated to the different channels are stored in the m_longTermMap
and recomputed only if the associated channel matrix is updated or if the
transmitting and/or receiving beamforming vectors have changed. Given the channel
reciprocity assumption, for each node pair a single long term component is saved in the map.

5. Apply the small scale fading, calculate the channel gain, generate the
frequency domain 3D spectrum channel matrix, and finally compute the received PSD
The method CalcBeamformingGain computes the channel gain in each sub-band and
applies it to the PSD of the transmitted signal to obtain the received PSD.
To compute the sub-band gain, it accounts for the Doppler phenomenon and the
time dispersion effect on each cluster.
In order to reduce the computational load, the Doppler component of each
cluster is computed considering only the central ray.
Also, as specified :ref:`here <sec-3gpp-v2v-ff>`, it is possible to account for
the effect of environmental scattering following the model described in Sec. 6.2.3
of 3GPP TR 37.885.
This is done by deviating the Doppler frequency by a random value, whose
distribution depends on the parameter :math:`v_{scatt}`.
The value of :math:`v_{scatt}` can be configured using the attribute "vScatt"
(by default it is set to 0, so that the scattering effect is not considered).
Function GenSpectrumChannelMatrix generates the received PSD for each pair of
the transmit and receive antenna ports. It creates a frequency domain 3D spectrum
channel matrix whose dimensions are the number of receive antena ports,
the number of transmit antenna ports, and the number of resource blocks.
Finally, the frequency domain 3D spectrum channel matrix is used to obtain the
received PSD. In case of multiple ports at the transmitter the PSD is calculated
by summing per each RB the real parts of the diagonal elements of the (H*P)^h * (H*P),
where H is the frequency domain spectrum channel matrix and P is the precoding matrix.


ThreeGppChannelModel
####################

The class ThreeGppChannelModel implements the channel matrix generation procedure
described in Sec. of [TR38901]_.
The main method is GetChannel, which takes as input the mobility models of
the transmitter and receiver nodes, the associated antenna objects,
and returns a ChannelMatrix object containing:

* the channel matrix of size UxSxN, where U is the number of receiving antenna elements, S is the number of transmitting antenna elements and N is the number of clusters

* the clusters delays, as an array of size N

* the clusters arrival and departure angles, as a 2D array in which each row corresponds to a direction (AOA, ZOA, AOD, ZOD) and each column corresponds to a different cluster

* a time stamp indicating the time at which the channel matrix was generated

* the node IDs

* other channel parameters

The ChannelMatrix objects are saved in the map m_channelMap and updated when the coherence time
expires, or in case the LOS/NLOS channel condition changes.
The coherence time can be configured through
the attribute "UpdatePeriod", and should be chosen by taking into account all the
factors that affects the channel variability, such as mobility, frequency,
propagation scenario, etc. By default, it is set to 0, which means that the
channel is recomputed only when the LOS/NLOS condition changes.
It is possible to configure the propagation scenario and the operating frequency
of interest through the attributes "Scenario" and "Frequency", respectively.

**Blockage model:** 3GPP TR 38.901 also provides an optional
feature that can be used to model the blockage effect due to the
presence of obstacles, such as trees, cars or humans, at the level
of a single cluster. This differs from a complete blockage, which
would result in an LOS to NLOS transition. Therefore, when this
feature is enabled, an additional attenuation is added to certain
clusters, depending on their angle of arrival. There are two possi-
ble methods for the computation of the additional attenuation, i.e.,
stochastic (Model A) and geometric (Model B). In this work, we
used the implementation provided by [Zhang]_, which
uses the stochastic method. In particular, the model is implemented by the
method CalcAttenuationOfBlockage, which computes the additional attenuation.
The blockage feature can be disable through the attribute "Blockage". Also, the
attributes "NumNonselfBlocking", "PortraitMode" and "BlockerSpeed" can be used
to configure the model.

Testing
#######
The test suite ThreeGppChannelTestSuite includes five test cases:

* ThreeGppChannelMatrixComputationTest checks if the channel matrix has the
  correct dimensions and if it correctly normalized

* ThreeGppChannelMatrixUpdateTest, which checks if the channel matrix
  is correctly updated when the coherence time exceeds

* ThreeGppSpectrumPropagationLossModelTest, which tests the functionalities
  of the class ThreeGppSpectrumPropagationLossModel. It builds a simple
  network composed of two nodes, computes the power spectral density
  received by the receiving node, and

    1. Checks if the long term components for the direct and
       the reverse link are the same,
    2. Checks if the long term component is updated when changing
       the beamforming vectors,
    3. Checks if the long term is updated when changing the channel matrix

* ThreeGppCalcLongTermMultiPortTest, which tests that the channel matrices are
  correctly generated when multiple transmit and receive antenna ports are used.

* ThreeGppMimoPolarizationTest, which tests that the channel matrices are
  correctly generated when dual-polarized antennas are being used.

**Note:** TR 38.901 includes a calibration procedure that can be used to validate
the model, but it requires some additional features which are not currently
implemented, thus is left as future work.

Two-Ray fading model
====================
The model aims to provide a performance-oriented alternative to the 3GPP TR 38.901
framework [TR38901]_ which is implemented in the ``ThreeGppSpectrumPropagationLossModel`` and
``ThreeGppChannelModel`` classes and whose implementation is described in [Zugno2020]_.
The overall design described in [Pagin2023]_ follows the general approach of [Polese2018]_, with aim of providing
the means for computing a 3GPP TR 38.901-like end-to-end channel gain by combining
several statistical terms. The frequency range of applicability is the same as
that of [TR38901]_, i.e., 0.5 - 100 GHz.

Use-cases
#########
The use-cases for this channel model comprise large-scale MIMO simulations involving a high
number of nodes (100+), such as multi-cell LTE and 5G deployments in dense urban areas, for which
the full 3GPP TR 38.901 does not represent a viable option.

Implementation - ``TwoRaySpectrumPropagationLossModel``
#######################################################
The computation of the channel gain is taken care of by the ``TwoRaySpectrumPropagationLossModel``
class. In particular, the latter samples a statistical term which combines:

* The array and beamforming gain, computed as outlined in [Rebato2018]_ using the
  ``CalcBeamformingGain`` function. This term supports the presence of multiple
  antenna elements both at the transmitter and at the receiver and arbitrary antenna
  radiation patterns. Specifically, the array gain is compute as:

.. math::

  G_{\mathrm{AA}}(\theta, \varphi)=\left|\boldsymbol{a}^{\mathrm{T}}(\theta, \varphi)
  \boldsymbol{w}\left(\theta_0, \varphi_0\right)\right|^2=\left|\mathrm{AF}_{\mathrm{v}}(\theta,
  \varphi)\right|^2\left|\mathrm{AF}_{\mathrm{h}}(\theta, \varphi)\right|^2 G(\theta, \varphi),
..

where:

.. math::

  \operatorname{AF}_{\mathrm{v}}(\theta, \varphi)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N_{\mathrm{v}}}}
  \sum_{m=0}^{N_{\mathrm{v}}-1} e^{j k d_{\mathrm{v}} m\left(\cos \theta-\cos \theta_0\right)}
..

and:

.. math::

  \operatorname{AF}_{\mathrm{h}}(\theta, \varphi)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N_{\mathrm{h}}}}
  \sum_{n=0}^{N_{\mathrm{h}}-1} e^{j k d_{\mathrm{h}} n\left(\sin \theta
  \sin \varphi-\sin \theta_0 \sin \varphi_0\right)}
..

In turn, :math:`N_h`, :math:`N_v` are the number of horizontal and vertical antenna
elements respectively, :math:`d_h`, :math:`d_v` are the element spacing in the
horizontal and vertical direction respectively. The figures below depict the resulting
array radiation pattern versus the relative azimuth of transmitter and receiver, for antenna
arrays featuring 3GPP TR 38.901 (``ThreeGppAntennaModel``, top) and isotropic
(``IsotropicAntennaModel``, bottom) antenna elements, respectively.
These figures match the corresponding plots of [Asplund]_.

.. _fig-two-ray-spectrum-loss-model-3gpp-radiation-pattern:

.. figure:: figures/two-ray-spectrum-loss-model-3gpp-radiation-pattern.*
   :width: 400
   :align: center

   Radiation pattern produced by the ``CalcBeamformingGain`` method when using
   antenna arrays featuring ``ThreeGppAntennaModel`` antenna elements, for various
   Uniform Planar Array (UPA) configurations.

.. _fig-two-ray-spectrum-loss-model-iso-radiation-pattern:

.. figure:: figures/two-ray-spectrum-loss-model-iso-radiation-pattern.*
   :width: 400
   :align: center

   Radiation pattern produced by the ``CalcBeamformingGain`` method when using
   antenna arrays featuring ``IsotropicAntennaModel`` antenna elements, for various
   Uniform Planar Array (UPA) configurations.

Whenever the link is in NLOS, a penalty factor is introduced, to account for beam
misalignment due to the lack of a dominant multipath component [Kulkarni]_.


* A fast fading term, sampled using the Fluctuating Two Ray (FTR) model distribution [Romero]_.
  The latter is a fading model which is more general than typical ones, taking into account two
  dominant specular components and a mixture of scattered paths. As, a consequence it has
  been shown to provide a better fit to fading phenomena at mmWaves. The model parameters
  are automatically picked once the simulation scenario is set, using a lookup table which
  associates the simulation parameters (such as carrier frequency and LOS condition) to the
  FTR parameters providing the best fit to the corresponding TR 38.901 channel statistics.
  As a consequence, this channel model can be used for all the frequencies which are
  supported by the 38.901 model, i.e., 0.5-100 GHz. The calibration has been done by
  first obtaining the statistics of the channel gain due to the small-scale fading in
  the 3GPP model, using an ad hoc simulation script
  (``src/spectrum/examples/three-gpp-two-ray-channel-calibration.cc``). Then, this information
  has been used as a reference to estimate the FTR parameters yielding the closest
  (in a goodness-of-fit sense) fading realizations, using a custom Python script
  (``src/spectrum/utils/two-ray-to-three-gpp-ch-calibration.py``).

**Note:**

  * To then obtain a full channel model characterization, the model is intended to be
    used in conjunction of the path loss and shadowing capability provided by the
    ``ThreeGppPropagationLossModel`` class.
    Indeed, the goal of this model is to provide channel realizations which are as close
    as possible to ones of [TR38901]_, but at a fraction of the complexity. Since the
    path loss and shadowing terms are not computationally demanding anyway, the ones of
    [Zugno2020]_ have been kept;

  * Currently, the value of NLoS beamforming factor penalty factor is taken from
    the preliminary work of [Kulkarni]_ and it is scenario-independent; As future
    work, the possibility of using scenario-dependent penalty factors will be
    investigated.

Calibration
###########
The purpose of the calibration procedures is to compute offline a look-up table which
associates the FTR fading model parameters with the simulation parameters.
In particular, the [TR38901]_ fading distributions depend on:

* The scenario (RMa, UMa, UMi-StreetCanyon, InH-OfficeOpen, InH-OfficeMixed);

* The LOS condition (LoS/NLoS); and

* The carrier frequency.

As a consequence, the calibration output is a map which associates LoS condition and
scenario to a list of carrier frequency-FTR parameters values. The latter represent the
FTR parameters yielding channel realizations which exhibit the closest statistics to [TR38901]_.

The actual calibration is a two-step procedure which:

1. First generates reference channel gain curves using the
``src/spectrum/examples/three-gpp-two-ray-channel-calibration.cc`` simulation script.
Specifically, the script samples ``numRealizations`` channel realizations and computes for each of them
the end-to-end channel gain by setting the speed of the TX and RX pair to :math:`0`, disabling the shadowing
and fixing the LOS condition. In such a way, any variation around the mean is due to the small-scale fading only.
The channel gain samples are produced, and returned on output conditioned on the value of
``enableOutput``, for each combination of LoS condition, channel model scenario and carrier frequency. The
latter cover the whole [TR38901]_ frequency range of 0.5 - 100 GHz with a relatively sparse resolution
(500 MHz), since the dependency of the fading distribution with respect to the carrier frequency is actually
relatively weak.

.. _fig-three-gpp-gain-reference-gain-vs-fc:

.. figure:: figures/three-gpp-gain-reference-gain-vs-fc.*
   :width: 400
   :align: center

   Empirical CDF of the reference channel gains obtained using the  ``three-gpp-two-ray-channel-calibration``
   simulation script when keeping a fixed LoS condition and channel scenario and varying the carrier
   frequency only.

2. Then, the output of the above script is parsed by the ``two-ray-to-three-gpp-ch-calibration.py``
Python companion script. In particular, reference ECDFs are obtained from the channel gains sampled using the
model of [TR38901]_. In turn, the reference ECDFs (one for each LoS condition, channel model scenario
and carrier frequency combination) are compared to FTR distributions ECDFs obtained using different values
of the parameters. Finally, the parameters which provide the best fit (in a goodness-of-fit sense) for
the specific scenario, LOS condition and carrier frequency are found. The parameters to test are picked initially
by performing an exhaustive search within a discrete grid of possible values, and then by iteratively refining
the previous search runs by scanning the neighborhood of the most recent identified values.
In such regard, the Anderson-Darling statistical test is used to rank the various FTR distributions
and eventually pick the one providing the closest approximation to the reference statistics.

Testing
#######
The test suite ``TwoRaySplmTestSuite`` includes three test cases:

* ``FtrFadingModelAverageTest``, which checks that the average of the Fluctuating Two Ray (FTR)
  fading model realizations is consistent with the theoretical value provided in [Romero]_.

* ``ArrayResponseTest``, which checks that the overall array response at boresight computed by the ù
  ``CalcBeamformingGain`` function coincides with the expected theoretical values.

* ``OverallGainAverageTest``, which checks that the average overall channel gain obtained using the
  ``DoCalcRxPowerSpectralDensity`` method of the ``TwoRaySpectrumPropagationLossModel`` class is close
  (it is, after all, a simplified and performance-oriented model) to the one obtained using
  the ``ThreeGppSpectrumPropagationLossModel`` and ``ThreeGppChannelModel`` classes.
