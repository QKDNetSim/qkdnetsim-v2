/**

/**
 * \ingroup core
 * \def NS_DEPRECATED
 * Mark a function as deprecated.
 *
 * Users should expect deprecated features to be removed eventually.
 *
 * When deprecating a feature, please update the documentation
 * with information for users on how to update their code.
 *
 * For example,
 * \snippet src/core/doc/deprecated-example.h doxygen snippet
 *
 * Please follow these two guidelines to ease future maintenance
 * (primarily the eventual removal of the deprecated code):
 *
 * 1.  Please use the versioned form `NS_DEPRECATED_3_XX`,
 *     not the generic `NS_DEPRECATED`.
 *
 * 2.  Typically only the declaration needs to be deprecated,
 *
 *     \code
 *     NS_DEPRECATED_3_XX ("see TheNewWay") void SomethingUseful ();
 *     \endcode
 *
 *     but it's helpful to put the same macro as a comment
 *     at the site of the definition, to make it easier to find
 *     all the bits which eventually have to be removed:
 *
 *     \code
 *     \/\* NS_DEPRECATED_3_XX ("see TheNewWay") *\\/
 *     void SomethingUseful () { ... }
 *     \endcode.
 *
 * \note Sometimes it is necessary to silence a deprecation warning.
 * Even though this is highly discouraged, if necessary it is possible to use:
 * \code
 *   NS_WARNING_PUSH_DEPRECATED;
 *   // call to a function or class that has been deprecated.
 *   NS_WARNING_POP;
 * \endcode
 * These macros are defined in warnings.h
 *
 * \param msg Optional message to add to the compiler warning.
